Cut my life into pieces, this is my last resort
Suffocation, no breathing
Don't give a fuck, if I cut my arm bleeding
This is my last resort

Cut my life into pieces
I've reached my last resort â€“ suffocation, no breathing
Don't give a fuck, if I cut my arms bleeding
Do you even care, if I die bleeding?
Would it be wrong, would it be right
If I took my life tonight? Chances are that I might
Mutilation out of sight
And I'm contemplatin' suicide

'Cause I'm losin' my sight, losin' my mind
Wish somebody would tell me I'm fine
Losin' my sight, losin' my mind
Wish somebody would tell me I'm fine

I never realized I was spread too thin
'Til it was too late and I was empty within
Hungry, feeding on chaos and livin' in sin
Downward spiral, where do I begin?
It all started when I lost my mother
No love for myself and no love for another
Searchin' to find a love upon a higher level
Findin' nothin' but questions and devils

'Cause I'm losin' my sight, losin' my mind
Wish somebody would tell me I'm fine
Losin' my sight, losin' my mind
Wish somebody would tell me I'm fine

Nothing's alright, nothing is fine
I'm runnin' and I'm crying
I'm crying, I'm crying
I'm crying, I'm crying
I can't go on living this way

Can't go on living this way
Nothing's alright
