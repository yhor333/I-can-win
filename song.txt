[Intro]
Cut my life into pieces, this is my last resort
Suffocation, no breathing
Don't give a fuck, if I cut my arm bleeding
This is my last resort

[Verse 1]
Cut my life into pieces
I've reached my last resort â€“ suffocation, no breathing
Don't give a fuck, if I cut my arms bleeding
Do you even care, if I die bleeding?
Would it be wrong, would it be right
If I took my life tonight? Chances are that I might
Mutilation out of sight
And I'm contemplatin' suicide
[Chorus]
'Cause I'm losin' my sight, losin' my mind
Wish somebody would tell me I'm fine
Losin' my sight, losin' my mind
Wish somebody would tell me I'm fine

[Verse 2]
I never realized I was spread too thin
'Til it was too late and I was empty within
Hungry, feeding on chaos and livin' in sin
Downward spiral, where do I begin?
It all started when I lost my mother
No love for myself and no love for another
Searchin' to find a love upon a higher level
Findin' nothin' but questions and devils

[Chorus]
'Cause I'm losin' my sight, losin' my mind
Wish somebody would tell me I'm fine
Losin' my sight, losin' my mind
Wish somebody would tell me I'm fine

[Bridge]
Nothing's alright, nothing is fine
I'm runnin' and I'm crying
I'm crying, I'm crying
I'm crying, I'm crying
I can't go on living this way

[Verse 3]
Cut my life into pieces
This is my last resort
Suffocation, no breathing
Don't give a fuck if I cut my arm bleeding
Would it be wrong, would it be right
If I took my life tonight? Chances are that I might
Mutilation out of sight
And I'm contemplating suicide

[Chorus]
'Cause I'm losin' my sight, losin' my mind
Wish somebody would tell me I'm fine
Losin' my sight, losin' my mind
Wish somebody would tell me I'm fine

[Outro]
Nothing's alright, nothing is fine
I'm runnin' and I'm crying
I can't go on living this way
Can't go on living this way
Nothing's alright
